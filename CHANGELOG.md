# Changelog

## v1.0.7 — 2026-04-23

Removed the voice-input feature.

v1.0.5 and v1.0.6 shipped a microphone button backed by the `ohr` CLI. On installed, signed, notarized builds it never actually transcribed live microphone input — not once. Three successive patches (in-process `AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess`, audio-input entitlement, single-line entitlement XML for the AMFI kernel parser) each fixed a visible layer without fixing the end-to-end path. Rather than keep patching a subprocess architecture that fights macOS TCC + Hardened Runtime at every turn, the feature is removed in full.

- Mic button, Voice settings tab, `ohr` subprocess wrapper, microphone permission shim, voice fixture + tests — all deleted.
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` removed from Info.plist.
- `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` removed from entitlements.
- Bundled `ohr` helper removed from the build script; releases no longer carry it.
- Full post-mortem kept at `docs/learnings/voice-input-ohr.md` so the next attempt at voice input doesn't repeat these mistakes. Recommendation: use Apple's in-process `Speech` framework, not a spawned CLI.

258 tests green.
